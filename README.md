# Spatial ecology cheatheet

This is a rather random assortment of references on issues of geometry, fractals, aggregation and scaling in ecology.

## Fractals

## Scaling of beta diversity

- [Mokany et al. 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.12175/full) did simulation study exploring scaline of paiwise beta diversity with area.
- [Mokany et al. 2011](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01675.x/full) made a crazy algorithm that can combine alpha and beta diversity to predict spatial patterns of both richness and composition.

## Patterns of aggregation

Dylan has pointed me out to [Condit et al. 2000](http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Condit%20et%20al%202000.pdf) who found that most BCI trees follow spatial distribution that deviates from random.
