# Spatial ecology cheatheet

This is a rather random assortment of references on issues of geometry, fractals, aggregation and scaling in ecology.

## General treatments
- [Storch et al. 2007](http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9780511814938) put together a multiauthor book which is highly relevant on the issues of scaling, biodiversity, fractals, species-area relationships and geometry.

## Fractals

- [Halley et al. 2004](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2004/halley2004a.pdf) provide, to my knowledge, the most useful and authoritative practical guide to fractals in ecology.

## Scaling of beta diversity

- [Mokany et al. 2013](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbi.12175/full) did simulation study exploring scaline of paiwise beta diversity with area.
- [Mokany et al. 2011](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01675.x/full) made a crazy algorithm that can combine alpha and beta diversity to predict spatial patterns of both richness and composition.
- [Keil et al. 2012](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02701.x/abstract) explore **spatial scaling of distance decay of similarity**.

## Patterns of aggregation

Dylan has pointed me out to [Condit et al. 2000](http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Condit%20et%20al%202000.pdf) who found that most BCI trees follow spatial distribution that deviates from random.

## Spatial scaling of biotic interactions

- [Araujo & Rozenfeld 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00643.x/full) write on sptail scaling of biotic interactions.
- [Seguardo et al. 2012](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232273519_Patterns_of_coexistence_of_two_species_of_freshwater_turtles_are_affected_by_spatial_scale) write on scale-dependency of coexistence of two species of freshwater turtles.

## Sizling & Storch school

## Kunin et al. school

- [Azaele et al. 2012](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225077957_Downscaling_species_occupancy_from_coarse_spatial_scales) provide the best introduction to and evaluation of single-species occupancy downscaling.
